# disaster-relief-funding-ml

This project develops machine learning models to predict disaster relief funding amounts by integrating FEMA public assistance data with Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) socioeconomic indicators. It applies extensive preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), supervised learning methods (classification and regression), and hyperparameter tuning to demonstrate an end-to-end ML workflow on high-dimensional, real-world policy data.
